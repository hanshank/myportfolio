          | Hi. My name is Hans Martin Hanken. I am working as a Software Engineer in sunny Los Angeles, California. I
          | also
          | do freelance web development and design. I am genuinly passionate about my work and love making fast,
          | attractive
          | and effective modern web applications.

          | I started my
          | coding journey in programming languages such as Ruby, using the well known Ruby on Rails framework. Today I
          | do most of my
          | work in Java Script based stacks, but I believe that solid programming fundamentals can be transferred to most
          | languages,
          | frameworks and tools. If I am
          | not spending my days
          | coding and developing, you’ll often find my outside, with our dog Mishca.
